# Background

This is an example rmarkdown document you can use to complete the [*R4EnvChem* Tutorial](https://davidrosshall.github.io/R4EnvChem/r-tutorial-exercise.html). It showcases some important `rmarkdown` features. Assuming you've downloaded the entire *R4EnvChem* project template, and downloaded the packages listed in [Section 5](https://davidrosshall.github.io/R4EnvChem/r-tutorial-exercise.html), it should work out of the box.

## Importing data

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

airData <- read_csv(file = "data/2018-07-01_60430_Toronto_ON.csv")
head(airData)
```


## Visualizing data

```{r, fig.cap="Time series plot of ambiant airborn pollutant concentrations measured by downtown Toronto NAPS station 60430"}

ggplot(data = airData, 
       aes(x = date.time, 
           y = concentration, 
           colour = pollutant)) +
  geom_line()

```

```{r}

# Try and make another type of visualization with your data (i.e. box plot, violin plot)
# or enhance the default geom_line plot (i.e. marginal histograms, aesthetic changes)



```
