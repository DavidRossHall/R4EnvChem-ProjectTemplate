# R4EnvChem-ProjectTemplate

This repository hosts documents, files, and datasets related to the [R4EnvChem](https://davidrosshall.github.io/R4EnvChem/) book. It's essentially a template for R projects that students can modify to suit their needs. 

## Instructions for downloading template: 

Click the green `code` button, and select *Download Zip* to download the entire repository (code, documents, files, and images). Once downloaded, unpack the `zip` file (instructions for [Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/zip-and-unzip-files-8d28fa72-f2f9-712f-67df-f80cf89fd4e5) and [Apple](https://support.apple.com/en-ca/guide/mac-help/mchlp2528/mac)). 

## Opening a project

From the template folder you've just unpacked, open the `R4EnvChem-ProjectTemplate.Rproj` file in *RStudio*; you should see *R4EnvChem-ProjectTemplate* in the top right corner of *RStudio* indicating you're working in the correct *RStudio* project. Once this is done, you can follow along with the example code used in *R4EnvChem* in addition to the [Section 1 Tutorial](https://davidrosshall.github.io/R4EnvChem/r-tutorial-exercise.html)

## Using template for different project

To recycle/repurpose the template, simply rename the folder and the `.Rproj` file. You can then rename any subsequent files to suit your needs.
